              <h1>POVERTY IS STILL A PROBLEM</h1>
              <p>Poverty is a problem that has been around for an exceedingly long time. Even though extensive improvements have been made over the last decades, it still remains a huge problem today.  <a href="sources.html" class="footnote">[source 1]</a> <br><br>It is estimated that around 10% of the world’s population were living in poverty in 2015, that is more than 700 million people who are struggling to make meets end.  <a href="sources.html" class="footnote">[source 2]</a> <br><br> Many people dismiss the problem since they are personally not affected by it. As long as any percentage of the world’s population is living in extreme poverty, we are all affected by it. Poverty hinders our progress as a society. Imagine if Albert Einstein or Isaac Newton were living in extreme poverty, how different would the world be today?</p>

              <h1>OUR MISSION</h1>
              <p> Poverty can seem like an impossible problem to solve, and quite scary to approach. Luckily, there are organizations out there working hard towards ending poverty. Some organizations work in certain areas, some work specifically with children and others work where help is required the most. <br><br>These organizations require economic support, as well as volunteers to be able to continue their battle against poverty. This is where we all can lend a hand, whether it be volunteering or donating money. But this can prove to be a harder task than it seems at first. <br><br>Where and how can you donate? Where and how can you volunteer? What organization should you be donating to? We at The Map of Giving are here to make it easier for you to be a part of the battle against poverty.

    <h1>THE MAP OF GIVING</h1>
    <p>The Map of Giving is an interactive map that shows what regions are most affected by poverty, and what organizations work there. Countries and/or regions who are in need of help will be marked as red on the map.<br> When the user clicks on a region, the map will give information about the region clicked. It will also show which organizations are currently working in that region and are accepting donations and/or volunteers. <br> The Map of Giving will make it easier for everyone to get involved and help in the battle against poverty. The map shown on the website is only a prototype to give a better idea of how The Map of Giving truly can make an impact. </p>
